Welcome to Tud's Rotund Journey!

Controls are WASD for movement

The goal is to continue eating the meat and avoiding the gluten (Tud is allergic to gluten!)

If you eat the meat, you get more time, have fewer invincibility frames when touching the bread, and causes more bread appears. If you touch the bread, you lose some time. Eat as much meat as you can before the time runs out!

Music used: "Jumper" by Waterflame. The creator has said that their songs can be used for not-for-profit
projects and thus my use is completely fine.

Installation: download the python programming language and put the python code into a usable IDE (such as Visual Studio Code) and click the run button in the top right.
